# door opening produced no state change at all: nothing in history, nothing an
# automation could trigger on, and the sensor sat on a value no later event
# was guaranteed to clear. It is mapped to the state the event actually
# reports (open / active) and settled back a moment later by
# _schedule_opened_closed_settle, replaying the open-then-close that happened.
