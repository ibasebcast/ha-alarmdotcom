"""
Auto-off timer management for Alarm.com lights.

Lets any light entity in this integration be scheduled to turn off after a
duration. Deliberately more than a plain Home Assistant automation using a
"wait then turn off" action, in two ways an automation can't match on its
own:

- Survives a Home Assistant restart: the scheduled off-time is persisted via
  Store, and reloaded on startup. A timer whose time already passed while
  Home Assistant was offline fires immediately (catch-up); one still in the
  future is rescheduled for its remaining duration.
- The scheduled off-time is exposed as a queryable entity attribute
  (`auto_off_at` on the light itself - see light.py), so "time remaining"
  is available to templates and other automations without needing a
  separate helper entity.
